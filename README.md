ZfcRoleAdmin
============

Role administration interface for ZfcAdmin and BjyAuthorize

Requirements
============
BjyAuthorize https://github.com/bjyoungblood/BjyAuthorize
ZfcAdmin https://github.com/ZF-Commons/ZfcAdmin
ZfcUser https://github.com/ZF-Commons/ZfcUser
ZfcUserAdmin https://github.com/Danielss89/ZfcUserAdmin
And all of their dependencies.

This is my first ZF2 module.  It is not intended to make it to ZFC commons and probably does not follow a lot of the ZF2 best practices.  It may help someone get started in creating a real module that could make it into the commons.  Use it at your own risk.
